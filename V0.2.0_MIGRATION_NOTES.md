# VedDB v0.2.0 Migration Notes

## Workspace Restructuring Complete

The ved-db-server workspace has been successfully restructured for v0.2.0 development.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Workspace Configuration**
   - Version bumped from 0.1.1 to 0.2.0
   - Added new workspace dependencies for v0.2.0 features:
     - RocksDB for persistent storage
     - Cryptography libraries (aes-gcm, sha2, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, rustls)
     - Prometheus for metrics
     - Tauri for desktop GUI
     - Additional utilities (chrono, uuid, regex, config)

2. **Created veddb-compass Directory**
   - Basic Tauri project structure
   - React + TypeScript frontend setup
   - Vite build configuration
   - Placeholder icons (will be replaced in Task 17)
   - Currently excluded from workspace build (will be re-enabled in Task 17)

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Runs tests and linting on all platforms
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Builds release binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS

4. **Documentation**
   - `WORKSPACE_STRUCTURE.md`: Explains the workspace organization
   - `V0.2.0_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`: This file

### Workspace Members
